The data set for this project is taken from Kaggle
The Kaggle dataset "IPL Player Stats 2016-2022" was provided by user anandkumarsahu09. 
This dataset contains information about batting and bowling statistics for all IPL players from 2016 to 2022. 
The dataset is in CSV format.
The dataset contained multiple CSV files, including a file for each season of the IPL from 2016 to 2022. 
These files contained information about player statistics for each match played in the IPL season, including the player's team, runs scored, balls faced, wickets taken, etc.
